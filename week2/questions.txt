1. I spent about 2 hours on this assignment. 
2. The life critical problem was not very difficult. I was slightly unsure 
if you wanted us to describe its classes and class structures since the problem 
was a little vague but i tried to describe why some applications were life critical 
while also giving examples of certain specific applications
3. The second assignment (ereader) was more involved and more difficult out of the two

Im still getting used to the video format, so im sorry if it was too long because I
feel like i rambled a little bit.
