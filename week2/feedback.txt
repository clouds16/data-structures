1. I learned how to better design classes and subclasses to better design and encapsulate a
	class. 

2. I didnt know that you can make a list of objects, or a collection of objects.  While reading 
the book, i had some confusions, and i watched some additional videos on how to handle and program the 
logic for adding classes to a list/collection and how to use them more effectively

3. Coming up with a good hierarchy diagram for the e reader was the most dificult 

4. The discussion wasnt too bad this week.

5. I spent about 2 hours reading the materials and watching the videos/taking notes, and another
hour doing the homework and discussion
