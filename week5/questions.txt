1. I spent about an hour  to 2 on this assignment not including the reading
2. I had previous experience with some sorting algorithms so i didnt find any of the 
problems too difficult
3. I think the question regarding the list and dictionary was pretty vague, im not sure
if what i wrote was what you were looking for. Let me know if you would like me to redo
