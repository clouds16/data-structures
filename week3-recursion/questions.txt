1. this assignment took me about 2 hours to complete.
2. The easiest problem for me was actually to reverse a list. This was because i 
solved it by adding one list to another to make a final list.
[a] + [b] = [a,b]
3. The hardest problem was to find the min and the max. I think this problem would 
be easier if it was split up into a function that could find the min and one that 
can find the max.
